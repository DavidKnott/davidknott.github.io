    <h1 id='about'>Here's a little about me...</h1>
    <p>When I was 18, I went trekking in Nepal and sea-kayaking in Patagonia. When I was 19, I led a group of 8th-graders on a 14-day backpacking trip on Isle Royale. When I was 20, I rode through Vietnam on a motorcycle.  To sum up my life so far - I love adventure.
      <br>
      Spending time in nature has given me the opportunity to have insight into my own life, while spending time immersed in other cultures has allowed me to gain foresight into the lives of others.  Whether in the backcountry or foreign lands, I know how to take care of myself and those around me in almost any situation that may arise.  
      <br>
      Everything can be a learning experience and I am always applying what I learn to my day to day life.  I work as hard as I play.  Whether it’s chopping wood, leading kids in the wilderness or pulling my weight on a programming project, my goal is to finish with the best final product possible.

      If you’re interested in grabbing coffee and talking about how my skills can be an asset to you (or to talk about the benefits of silently sitting for 10 hours a day), please send an email my way.
