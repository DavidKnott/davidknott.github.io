    <h2>Starting Again</h2>
    <p>
      I loved module 1 because I had the chance to see my classmates and myself go from knowing next to nothing about Ruby to being able to create database structures that can communicate with other files and perform data analysis.  We didn’t only learn about coding though, we also learned a lot a bout each other.  My cohort had a sense of camaraderie that I’ve not seen in any other learning environment.  Everyone was willing to take the time to help those who were struggling.  I attribute this “no one left behind attitude” to Turing branding and success in attracting the students who are not only likely succeed on projects but will also continue to foster the ever growing Turing community.
      <br>
      I feel refreshed by the practicality of what I have learned.  Having high school and some college under my belt I have been frustrated by the lack of correlation between what I was learning and what I will use.   For the first time in my life I had the pleasure of seeing this connection, particularly from the numerous speakers who came in on a weekly basis and emphasized exactly what we were learning.
      <br>
      Overall, leaving your old life behind and starting again at Turing is no small decision but I feel fortunate to be on this winding road of
      ups and downs with cohort 1610.
